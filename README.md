# PLANT_IRRIGATION_SYSTEM
Civilization began with agriculture, and though humanity has changed significantly, agriculture still remains very important. Irrigation plays a vital role in agriculture. Besides, kitchen gardens are of a great interest to people. Although these gardens exist, people donâ€™t get the time to water their plants and end up leaving their plants dry or pouring excessing water all at once. This can be overcome with a smart soil moisture sensor which can sense the moisture level in the soil and provide water accordingly. Hence, water use will be optimal and plant growth will also be efficient. By implementing this project, the concept of microcontrollers and sensors were understood and practically experimented.
